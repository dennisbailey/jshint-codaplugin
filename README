A basic Plugin for Coda2 to add JSHint support

This plugin merely runs JSHint on save. It does not currently support configuration, but that will be added in the future.

Some code is borrowed/adapted from the awesome PHP & Web Toolkip plugin by Mario Fischer (http://www.chipwreck.de/blog/software/coda-php/)
